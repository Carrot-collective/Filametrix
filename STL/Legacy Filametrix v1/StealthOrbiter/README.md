**ORBITERMOUNT_No_Sensor_V3_Cutting v2.stl**

Cutting remix by SaltyPaws no sensor version.

**ORBITERMOUNT_Sensor_V3_Cutting v2.stl**

Cutting remix by SaltyPaws as above, but now with slot for below extruder filament sensor. Note that this needs to be printed with supports painted on for the sensor section, as bridging is not sufficient here. Sensor version uses v0.1 BOM limit switches (lever microswitch) with the end of the lever trimmed to fit. It uses the metal ball from the orbitor sensor (6 mm). M2 hex bolts can be threaded straight into the plastic, or you can melt a m2 nut on the other side.
